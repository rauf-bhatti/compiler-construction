- Made a DFA. Some problems regarding how to use set values/grammar was resolved by using Google. 
- JFlap was failing for RO's. Fixed it by pointing it to a final state. Was stuck on normal state before.
- Made separate Regular Expressions. After testing, the other challenging part was to combine them into one.
- Used OR operators and length qualifiers to solve the issue

CODE:
Code can be easily ran by bringing bash/terminal to the directory.
Run "make"
By running make, all dependencies should compile and an output file a.out should be produced.
Run this a.out file by specifying the filename of the code.

Some of the problems encountered while writing the code were to correctly handle all the cases. Also, handling cases where if space is taken out between forexample a keyword and a function bracket start. Moreover, efficiently handling the local vector array was also a problem that was addressed. 

Cases of operators were also of concerns and were addressed thoroughly.
